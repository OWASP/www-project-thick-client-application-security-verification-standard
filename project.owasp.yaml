name: OWASP Thick Client Application Security Verification Standard
pitch: The OWASP Thick Client Application Security Verification Standard (TASVS) Project aims to establish an open standard for securing thick client applications. This project provides a comprehensive framework for designing, building, and testing technical application security controls. The TASVS Project fills the gap between the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) for web applications and the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS). While the MASVS can be applied to thick client testing, it is not an ideal fit. The TASVS Project seeks to create a more suitable standard for these scenarios.
