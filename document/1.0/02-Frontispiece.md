# About the Standard

The OWASP Thick Client Application Security Verification Standard (TASVS) is the industry standard for thick client application security. It provides a comprehensive set of security controls that can be used to assess the security of thick client applications. The standard covers the key components of a thick client's attack surface including threat modelling, code quality, configuration, storage, cryptography and network communication.
